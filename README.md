# Puzzle_Breadth_First_Search

This application uses an AI Agent to find the quickest and shortest set of moves that it can take to reach a goal within the puzzle environment. 

The Agent uses the Breadth First Search Algorithm to reach the user-defined goal. In this case, the goal is to find the smallest set of moves that will get the red piece to the location of the orange piece.

The Agent uses Breadth First Search to explore all the possible moves that it can take, and shifts all the puzzle pieces around until it gets the red piece to the location of the orange piece. It eventually find its way to the goal state. Then once the goal state is obtained the Agent will return all the moves that lead it to the goal state and displays the moves on a graphical interface for the user to see.
